# 📊 Sales Prediction using Advertisement – OASIS Infobyte Internship Task 2

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising investments in TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.  
It demonstrates the power of regression models in understanding how marketing budgets impact sales outcomes.

This project was developed as part of my **Oasis Infobyte Internship** under the **Machine Learning Domain**.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To build a linear regression model that predicts product sales using advertisement spending data.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- TV: Advertising cost on TV (in thousands)
- Radio: Advertising cost on radio
- Newspaper: Advertising cost on newspapers
- Sales: Product sales (target variable)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧩 Steps Involved
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Data visualization and correlation study  
4. Splitting data into train and test sets  
5. Training a **Linear Regression** model  
6. Evaluating the model using metrics like RMSE and R² Score  

---

## 📈 Results
The model efficiently predicts sales based on ad spending.  
The analysis also provides clear visual insights into which advertising channel contributes the most to overall sales.
