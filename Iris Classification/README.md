# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification – OASIS Infobyte Internship Task 3

## 📘 Overview
The **Iris Flower Classification** project is based on the classical Iris dataset introduced by **Ronald A. Fisher** in 1936.  
It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers across three species:  
- *Iris setosa*  
- *Iris versicolor*  
- *Iris virginica*  

Each sample includes four numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) used to classify the species.  
This dataset is often regarded as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To train a classification model that can accurately identify the species of an Iris flower based on its features.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Samples:** 150  
- **Classes:** 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)  
- **Features:** 4 numerical measurements (in cm)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧩 Steps Involved
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Visualizing data distributions  
3. Preprocessing and encoding  
4. Splitting data into train and test sets  
5. Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree)  
6. Evaluating accuracy and confusion matrix  

---

## 📈 Results
The model accurately classifies the flower species with high precision and clarity, showcasing the effectiveness of supervised learning techniques.
