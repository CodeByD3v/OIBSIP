# 🚗 Car Price Prediction – OASIS Infobyte Internship Task 1

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on multiple factors such as brand reputation, horsepower, mileage, and various other features.  
Car price prediction is one of the key areas of research in machine learning, helping manufacturers, resellers, and customers understand fair pricing.

This project was developed as part of my **Oasis Infobyte Internship** under the **Machine Learning Domain**.

## 🧠 Objective
To build and train a regression model capable of accurately predicting car prices using machine learning techniques.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains several attributes that influence the price of a car.  
Typical features include:
- Brand or Company
- Model
- Engine Type
- Horsepower
- Mileage
- Year of Manufacture
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type  
and the target variable: **Price**

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧩 Steps Involved
1. Importing and exploring the dataset  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature selection and encoding  
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
5. Applying regression algorithms  
6. Evaluating model performance using metrics like R² score and MAE  

---

## 📈 Results
The trained model successfully predicts car prices with good accuracy and demonstrates how multiple attributes collectively influence vehicle pricing.
